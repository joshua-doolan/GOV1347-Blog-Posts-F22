      <description>Model Update This week, I will be predicting district-level Republican Two Party Vote Share from advertising data.
As always, scratch work can be found [here]https://github.com/joshua-doolan/GOV1347-Blog-Posts-F22/blob/main/content/post/2022-10-11-week-5-10-11-22-air-war/week5_py.ipynb).
Advertising Data This week, I take a look at two possible predictors for advertising on the district level: absolute advertising spend advantage. In theory, these are both measures of the same underlying data (both rely on $ spent), but have different potential modeling effects:</description>

      <description>Model Update This week, I will be taking a different approach to vote-share prediction than before. This will be my first week incorporating district-level predictions. District-level predictions all for more nuance, but suffer from a lack of commonly accessible data (a large issue for linear regression models). To begin this district analysis, I will focus on incumbency and expert predictions.
As always, scratch work can be found here.
Incumbency Incumbency has been widely shown to be a large predictor of electoral outcomes.</description>

      <description>Modeling Update For this week’s modeling update, I begin looking at the role of polling data in improving modeling outcomes. To investigate the role, I will start out with a base model (including economic factors and incumbency) and then add to it based on the polling data. I will be taking a look at predicting house-incumbent (the party with the plurality of house seats) two-party popular vote share.

      <description>Introduction Hello everyone! For this week’s blog, we’re going to be taking a look at how various different economic indicators (specifically GDP, RDI, CPI, and Unemployment) produce different outcomes for the 2022 midterm elections.
Before diving into the details of these different models, I wanted to mention, if you’re interested in seeing some of the “scratch work” for how I come to these analyses, please feel free to view my weekly notebooks on my Github (this week’s can be found here here).</description>
