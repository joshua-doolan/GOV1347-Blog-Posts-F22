# District Overview
The first important note about 2022's CA-45 is that it is a fundamentally different district than 2020's CA-45. The incumbent 2020 CA-45 representative is now in the CA-47 district, and the Republican nominee for 2022's CA-45 currently represents 2020's CA-48. With that in mind, here are the major differences between the old CA-45, and what the new CA-45 is.

## Geography
From [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/California%27s_45th_Congressional_District_election,_2022#District_map): ![CA 45 District Maps](CA 45 District Maps.png)

The new 45th district represents part of LA County and Orange County in Southern California. The new district is less concave than the 2020 district, due to the intent of the district to better represent Asian Americans, with less focus on geographic simplicity. This district essentially covers large chunks of the suburban Los Angeles.

## Demographics
The demographics of this district are the most important distinction of this district. This district has a much larger representation for Asian-American voters, a subset of voters that carries many divisions along ethnicity and partisan lines.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(
  group=c('White','Latino','Black','Asian'),
  value=c(35.6,23,4.5,36.9)
)

ggplot(data, aes(x="", y=value, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color="white") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  
  theme_void() +  # remove background, grid, numeric labels
  geom_text(aes(label = value),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))
```

(data according to the [California Target Book](https://californiatargetbook.com/) courtesy of the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-10-22/2022-california-midterm-election-guide-district-45-steel-chen))

Notably, the race highlighted the districts diverse demographics with the Republican nominee being a Korean-American immigrant and the Democratic nominee being the child of Taiwanese-American immigrants. Much of the race focused on appeals to Vietnamese-American immigrants based on US Policy towards China.

It is also worth noting that although the Asian-American focus drew much of the attention during the race, nearly two-thirds of the district is non-Asian-American, further highlighting the district's diversity.

Compared to the state as a whole, this district is roughly representative of the white population (35\% for the state vs 35.6\% for the district) and the black population (5\% for the state vs 4.5\% for the district), but overrepresents Asian Americans (15\% for the state vs 35.6\% for the district) and under-represents Latinos (39\% for the state vs 23\% for the district) according to the [2020 Census via the Public Policy Institute of California](https://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-population/#:~:text=No%20race%20or%20ethnic%20group,according%20to%20the%202020%20Census).   

## Candidates
### Republican Candidate (and winner) Michelle Steel
According to her own about page, "U.S. Representative Michelle Steel is a public servant, immigrant, tax-fighter, and one of the first Korean-American women ever to serve in Congress." ([Steel Campaign Website](https://michellesteelca.com/about/)). Importantly, Michelle Steel was an incumbent (of the 2020 48th district which partially overlapped with 2022's 45th), which provides a heavy advantage in most forecasts. She describes herself as having held public office since 2006, and highlights her anti-tax increase agenda. Furthermore, she highlights her immigration from South Korea with her family.

Notably, her primary focus is on fixing the economy, largely using tax cuts, with secondary focuses of breaking partisan gridlock and fixing the healthcare system. She focuses on her local Californian background, and makes no mention of national Republican focuses.

### Democratic Candidate Jay Chen
According to his website, "Jay Chen is a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserves, trustee for Mt. San Antonio Community College, and a small business owner." ([Chen Campaign Website](https://chenforcongress.com/meet-the-candidate/))

Jay Chen seeks to highlight both his local connections and his global viewpoint. On the local connections side, he brings his ties from having grown up near the district, attending local public schools, and returning to be a small business owner while working on education locally being on the board of a community college and working with the school district to improve its langauge classes.

To emphasize his global viewpoint, he discusses his time in the Naval Reserves working in Korea and the Middle East, studying and working in Asia and Latin America after attending Harvard, and then working for a global consulting firm (Bain, the name of which he notably leaves off his campaign materials.) 

His main campaign focuses are on "fixing a broken Washington" (presumably with more bipartisanship, which he stresses from his military background), making healthcare cheaper, fixing the economy with support to small businesses and addressing supply chain issues, and standing for veteran issues.   

# Forecast vs Final Outcome
[538's final race projection](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/california/45/) had Michelle Steel at 81\% chance of winning and Jay Chen at a 19\% chance of winning, and a vote share prediction of 53.2\% for the Republicans. The actual result was 52.6\%, meaning 538 had an R+0.6 error in the vote share prediction. Accordingly, this race ran very close to 538's predictions.

Furthermore, Cook Political Report, Inside Election, and Sabato's Crystal Ball all had this race at Lean Republican according to [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/California%27s_45th_Congressional_District_election,_2022#General_election_race_ratings). Likewise, these predictions seem to be within the range of results.

To note of these predictions: although 538 prefers to style its model as leading from the polls, it based its prediction for the race off of zero polls for this district. While it does not say which polling information it imputed from other districts using its CANTOR method, we can see that 538's prediction varied as the congressional generic poll changed.
