        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            District Overview The first important note about 2022’s CA-45 is that it is a fundamentally different district than 2020’s CA-45. The incumbent 2020 CA-45 representative is now in the CA-47 district, and the Republican nominee for 2022’s CA-45 currently represents 2020’s CA-48. With that in mind, here are the major differences between the old CA-45, and what the new CA-45 is.
Geography From Ballotpedia: The new 45th district represents part of LA County and Orange County in Southern California.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Model Update This week for the model, I wanted to incorporate shocks, but inherently, these are non-repeatable events. Instead, I focused on testing the sensititivity of my existing model.
For review, my previous model had two components: a model for predicting competitive races, and a model for predicting non-competitive races. Each model seeks to predict for an individual district the two party vote share for Republicans. Each model carries the same weights/parameters for each district, which is a deliberate modeling choice as opposed to unique parameters for each district, because in 2022, the redistricting inherently causes some issues (for new districts, there is zero data, and for moved districts, such as CA-45, the underlying demographics have fundamentally shifted).

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            For this week, I focus my attention on two things: first incorporating information about the ground game (in the form of district level turnout) and on expanding my district model beyond competitive races.
As always, you can find my data preparation work here.
Ground Game To incorporate the ground game, I focused on district-level turnout information. This is due to the fact that one of the main efforts of the ground game is to mobilize voters, which would represent itself in the turnout.

            Model Update This week, I will be predicting district-level Republican Two Party Vote Share from advertising data.

Advertising Data This week, I take a look at two possible predictors for advertising on the district level: absolute advertising spend advantage. In theory, these are both measures of the same underlying data (both rely on $ spent), but have different potential modeling effects:

        <p>
            Model Update This week, I will be taking a different approach to vote-share prediction than before. This will be my first week incorporating district-level predictions. District-level predictions all for more nuance, but suffer from a lack of commonly accessible data (a large issue for linear regression models). To begin this district analysis, I will focus on incumbency and expert predictions.
As always, scratch work can be found here.
Incumbency Incumbency has been widely shown to be a large predictor of electoral outcomes.

        <p>
            Modeling Update For this week’s modeling update, I begin looking at the role of polling data in improving modeling outcomes. To investigate the role, I will start out with a base model (including economic factors and incumbency) and then add to it based on the polling data. I will be taking a look at predicting house-incumbent (the party with the plurality of house seats) two-party popular vote share.

        <p>
            Introduction Hello everyone! For this week’s blog, we’re going to be taking a look at how various different economic indicators (specifically GDP, RDI, CPI, and Unemployment) produce different outcomes for the 2022 midterm elections.
Before diving into the details of these different models, I wanted to mention, if you’re interested in seeing some of the “scratch work” for how I come to these analyses, please feel free to view my weekly notebooks on my Github (this week’s can be found here here).
